# Welcome
This project is based off the tutorial [React Tutorial with Popup Authentication: Build a React application using popup authentication and React Hooks](https://auth0.com/blog/build-react-apps-using-react-hooks-and-auth0-auth-popup/).

# TL:DR
Looking for an abbreviated version of the tutorial? Here is where you can find my crib notes - very much a work-in-progress as I follow along with the tutorial.

## Initial React setup
This tutorial requires the latest version of React, which is `React v16.8.0-alpha.0`. This needs to be installed after [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) has been installed.
```
$ npx create-react-app react-auth0-popup
$ cd react-auth0-popup
$ npm run start

Verify that create-react-app has successfully installed by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

$ npm install -S react@16.8.0-alpha.0 react-dom@16.8.0-alpha.0
```

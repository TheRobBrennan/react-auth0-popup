# Overview
I would like to take this example a step further and deploy both the server and the client side code to [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now).

Branch `zeit-now` will be where this work occurs.

Specific features and enhancements include:
+ [Docker](https://www.docker.com) setup to develop locally and deploy the application to production.

IMPORTANT: You will need to provide your own credentials and other secrets!! Please see `DOCKER.md` for more details.
